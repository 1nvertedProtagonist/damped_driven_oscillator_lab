# PHYS 258 — Torsional Oscillator

This repository contains raw data, analysis code (Python + Jupyter),lab logbook (as a PDF), TeX source code, compiled PDF from TeX, and the final report for a damped and driven torsional oscillator lab.

## Structure
- data/raw/ — raw measurement files (not modified)
- src/ — reusable analysis code (labtools module)
- 
otebooks/ — exploration + analysis notebooks
- esults/figures/ — generated plots
- eport/ — LaTeX source + compiled PDF

## Reproducibility
1. Create an environment (see equirements.txt or environment.yml).
2. Run the analysis notebook(s) or scripts to regenerate figures.

## Note on use of AI assistance
Portions of the code were written with AI assistance for scaffolding and refactoring; all outputs were reviewed and tested by me.
